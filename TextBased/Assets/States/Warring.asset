  storyText: "Warring: This game was supposed to be bigger than this version but during
    the game making process the game maker (Batu Eren) was too lazy to do so. So some
    choices goes directly to the end. But don't worry this game still has 8 different
    ends. If you play the game for each of these 8 ends it would take only 20 minutes.\r\n\nNote:
    Push the key 1 or 2 to choice options. \n\r\nPls see all the ends.\r\n\r\n1- Continue"
