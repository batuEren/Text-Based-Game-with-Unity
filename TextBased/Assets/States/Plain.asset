    camp and start to look around. You don't see anything during 4 days.  With the
    dawn of the 5th day you hear steps when you look around. You see the army. Looks
    like they notice you. They come after you. You escape as fast as possible but
    when your horse exhausts you stop. Punishment for stopping in a chase like this
    is deadly. An arrow comes and kills you.\r\n\r\n1- Continue"
